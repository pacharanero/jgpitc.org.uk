The national IM&T programmes will be responsible for developing these arrangements and ensuring that all key stakeholders, especially clinicians, are fully involved in determining appropriate standards and methods of provision. The objective will be to provide clinicians and others with access to information wherever and whenever it is needed to support patient care. This will be subject to nationally agreed security and confidentiality conditions which take into account the requirement that information must be available for other medical practitioners looking after patients, subject normally to the patient\u2019s informed consent. 4.26 New arrangements will be established to provide these integrated services and applications. Inevitably this will involve a period of transition from the current situation during which systems will be upgraded or replaced and new systems will be developed and implemented. Suppliers will need to upgrade their products to meet new national standards in line with agreed national arrangements. 4.27 GPs and other healthcare professionals will have access to all the information they need to support delivery of patient care regardless of their location on a real-time basis. The support arrangements for data hosted by GPs will need to reflect this requirement. 4.28 The stated strategic direction for information systems to support primary care, including branch surgeries, is that systems must enable: (i) clinicians to access appropriate information about individual patients held on other systems for the clinical care and treatment of the patient (ii) users to interrogate and maintain individual patients\u2019 electronic health records with appropriate confidentiality safeguards (iii) inter-communication between clinical and administrative systems (iv) remote access to research papers, reviews, guidelines and protocols via the Internet and NHSnet (v) health professionals to access the knowledge base of healthcare at the point of contact with patients (vi) dispensing practices to have synchronous links (vii) the development of a framework for electronic prescribing. Ownership and liability issues 4.29 To facilitate the use of IM&T within primary care, PCOs, rather than practices, will be responsible for funding the purchase, maintenance, future upgrades and running costs of integrated IT systems as well as telecommunications links to branch surgeries and other NHS infrastructure and services. 4.30 This will mean that as new money is spent on providing new systems and upgrading existing systems, PCO ownership of the asset and the responsibility of the PCO to provide the full supporting service, including maintenance, future upgrades, paying for running costs of the new integrated systems and training, will be established at the same time. Under the new contract, IM&T services will be delivered to the practice based on a Service Level Agreement setting out in detail the responsibilities of the system suppliers. Costs of maintaining existing systems up to the point of migration to PCO ownership will be met in full by the PCO. 4.31 The GPC will provide an effective stakeholder and specification group for new systems, allowing GPs to be confident that these are fit for purpose and offering GPs the vital guarantees on security and confidentiality referred to in paragraph 4.25. 4.32 Future nationally specified IM&T initiatives will be delivered to practices with 100 per cent funding for initial and continuing costs. 4.33 PCO ownership of practice IM&T systems (hardware and software) will deliver the following benefits to practices: (i) funding for IM&T systems. Provision of funding, maintenance, support and future upgrades of practice IM&T systems will be clearly specified (ii) service level agreements. These will be based on a national template, allow local enhancements and additions to support future developments, and ensure that practices will receive higher quality IM&T services whilst preserving choice (iii) supplier management mechanisms. These will be put in place to manage supplier failure to deliver systems in line with the SLA (iv) nationally accredited systems. There will be PCO and practice involvement in defining national agreements, standards and systems requirements for national IT programmes which will support integrated healthcare. This will be achieved by the delivery of managed services that support whole communities, not just individual organisations (v) data confidentiality and security. The PCO will be responsible for ensuring data confidentiality and security are in accordance with agreed protocols (vi) liability. Liability issues will be fully managed by the PCO in line with local agreements with practices and via UK national service level agreements with suppliers removing the responsibility from the GP. Choice of nationally accredited systems 4.34 Systems will be accredited against national standards. Each practice will have guaranteed choice from a number of accredited systems that deliver the required functionality. Such choices will be consistent with local development plans (or their equivalents) and in line with local business cases and service level agreements. From 1 April 2003 every practice in the UK will have the choice of RFA-accredited systems. Practices will not subsequently be expected to exercise this right more frequently than every three years. 4.35 As patient care is increasingly delivered across multiple organisations, professions and sectors, the ability to implement nationally specified systems to support these arrangements is regarded as essential. 4.36 The GPC, NHS Confederation and Health Departments across the four countries appreciate and value the information held in current practice systems. Future strategies will ensure this information is protected. Development, implementation and support for primary care IM&T systems 4.37 UK standards that accommodate the specific requirements of the four countries will cover the development, implementation and support of IT systems in primary care. These will include standards and protocols relating to the access and management of electronic patient records, including the transition from existing arrangements. 4.38 Taking into account the different models of purchasing systems across the four countries, a national template SLA will be developed to support the development of future primary care IT systems providing practices with assurances on training, maintenance and support. The national template will allow local enhancements and additions in line with national programmes. 4.39 Practices will receive hardware and software upgrades from their supplier in a rolling programme as specified in their SLA. Mechanisms will be put in place to manage supplier failure to deliver systems in line with the SLA, which may also be subject to periodic reviews of implemented systems against the approved practice business case. 4.40 Professional bodies, including the GPC, will be fully involved in the definition of national agreements, standards and systems requirements and service level agreements that underpin them. Minimum functionality specification 4.41 Work is continuing to develop a minimum functionality specification for practice systems that defines the information requirements to deliver integrated care and meets the requirements of the new GMS contract. Education and training in use of IM&T 4.42 The initial and continuing education, training and support in the use of IM&T will be managed and properly funded by the PCO as part of a continuing practice development programme. Further information will be provided as part of the overall guidance on implementation of the contract. 4.43 In order to fulfil their new contractual obligations, practices will have to enter and retrieve high quality information from their practice clinical systems. Mechanisms will be put in place to ensure practice staff are fully supported with continuing training and education to ensure they are able to: (i) use and manage their particular clinical and administrative information systems including data entry and retrieval (ii) understand clinical nomenclatures and classifications (iii) ensure data quality (iv) implement change management and strategies to enable the move from paper to electronic records (v) manage the risks associated with an IT-dependent working environment including disaster recovery and ensuring operational continuity (vi) develop and implement workforce strategies to cope with the summarisation tasks associated with all clinical data flows into the practice. 4.44 Practices will ensure that practice IT systems which have been funded in whole or in part under previous NHS funding arrangements will continue to be available to support the new GMS contract on the basis of the new funding arrangements outlined in this chapter. Innovation in IM&T 4.45 Funding for innovation in the use of IM&T to support and enhance the delivery of patient care in general practice will come from a variety of funding streams including national sources. 4.46 It will be important for PCOs to ensure that any funding used to develop IM&T over and above the minimum requirements is in line with each country\u2019s IM&T strategy and an evaluation programme is developed. GP-to-GP patient record transfer 4.47 The new GMS contract requires greater use of the clinical system to record patient information. Key to the successful delivery of efficient and accurate data recording will be ease of transfer of data between practices. The \u2018GP-to-GP record transfer\u2019 project will enable clinical information to be transferred from one clinical system to another without the need for re-keying and therefore will save time and resources. Implementation 4.48 Arrangements for implementation of the above process will be developed for Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England in line with developing policy. As part of continuing discussions on the implementation of the new contract, the NHS Confederation will consult and negotiate with the GPC about how to address the transitional arrangements and timescales to meet the requirements of the new GMS contract.","title":"Gp contract"},{"location":"gp-contract.html#modernising-information-management-and-technology-in-general-practice","text":"4.25 Future information systems in primary care will be based on integration at a community level and on the concept of GPs receiving an information technology service rather than simply being provided with hardware and software.
