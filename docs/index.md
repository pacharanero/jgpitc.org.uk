# Joint GP IT Committee

The Joint GP IT Committee is the committee nominated by the BMA and RCGP to handle all issues relating to GP IT systems, GP data and future developments, for all 4 nations of the UK. It is empowered to act on behalf of General Practice on the basis of its inclusion in Paragraph 4.31 of the 2004 GP Contract.

These pages are intended to supply basic information about the Joint GP IT Committee and its work, correcting the lack of readily available information on the public internet about the Committee. The JGPITC aims to work as transparently as possible in representing the needs of GPs, other clinicians, and their patients.
