<h2 id="modernising-information-management-and-technology-in-general-practice">Modernising information management and technology in general practice</h2>
<p>4.25 Future information systems in primary care will be based on integration at a community level
and on the concept of GPs receiving an information technology service rather than simply
being provided with hardware and software. The national IM&amp;T programmes will be
responsible for developing these arrangements and ensuring that all key stakeholders,
especially clinicians, are fully involved in determining appropriate standards and methods of
provision. The objective will be to provide clinicians and others with access to information
wherever and whenever it is needed to support patient care. This will be subject to nationally
agreed security and confidentiality conditions which take into account the requirement that
information must be available for other medical practitioners looking after patients, subject
normally to the patient’s informed consent.</p>
<p>4.26 New arrangements will be established to provide these integrated services and applications.
Inevitably this will involve a period of transition from the current situation during which
systems will be upgraded or replaced and new systems will be developed and implemented.
Suppliers will need to upgrade their products to meet new national standards in line with
agreed national arrangements.</p>
<p>4.27 GPs and other healthcare professionals will have access to all the information they need to
support delivery of patient care regardless of their location on a real-time basis. The support
arrangements for data hosted by GPs will need to reflect this requirement.</p>
<p>4.28 The stated strategic direction for information systems to support primary care, including
branch surgeries, is that systems must enable:
(i) clinicians to access appropriate information about individual patients held on other
systems for the clinical care and treatment of the patient
(ii) users to interrogate and maintain individual patients’ electronic health records with
appropriate confidentiality safeguards
(iii) inter-communication between clinical and administrative systems
(iv) remote access to research papers, reviews, guidelines and protocols via the Internet
and NHSnet
(v) health professionals to access the knowledge base of healthcare at the point of
contact with patients
(vi) dispensing practices to have synchronous links
(vii) the development of a framework for electronic prescribing.
Ownership and liability issues</p>
<p>4.29 To facilitate the use of IM&amp;T within primary care, PCOs, rather than practices, will be
responsible for funding the purchase, maintenance, future upgrades and running costs of
integrated IT systems as well as telecommunications links to branch surgeries and other NHS
infrastructure and services.</p>
<p>4.30 This will mean that as new money is spent on providing new systems and upgrading existing
systems, PCO ownership of the asset and the responsibility of the PCO to provide the full
supporting service, including maintenance, future upgrades, paying for running costs of the
new integrated systems and training, will be established at the same time. Under the new
contract, IM&amp;T services will be delivered to the practice based on a Service Level Agreement
setting out in detail the responsibilities of the system suppliers. Costs of maintaining existing
systems up to the point of migration to PCO ownership will be met in full by the PCO.</p>
<p>4.31 The GPC will provide an effective stakeholder and specification group for new systems,
allowing GPs to be confident that these are fit for purpose and offering GPs the vital
guarantees on security and confidentiality referred to in paragraph 4.25.</p>
<p>4.32 Future nationally specified IM&amp;T initiatives will be delivered to practices with 100 per cent
funding for initial and continuing costs.</p>
<p>4.33 PCO ownership of practice IM&amp;T systems (hardware and software) will deliver the following
benefits to practices:
(i) funding for IM&amp;T systems. Provision of funding, maintenance, support and future
upgrades of practice IM&amp;T systems will be clearly specified
(ii) service level agreements. These will be based on a national template, allow local
enhancements and additions to support future developments, and ensure that
practices will receive higher quality IM&amp;T services whilst preserving choice
(iii) supplier management mechanisms. These will be put in place to manage supplier
failure to deliver systems in line with the SLA
(iv) nationally accredited systems. There will be PCO and practice involvement in
defining national agreements, standards and systems requirements for national IT
programmes which will support integrated healthcare. This will be achieved by the
delivery of managed services that support whole communities, not just individual
organisations
(v) data confidentiality and security. The PCO will be responsible for ensuring data
confidentiality and security are in accordance with agreed protocols
(vi) liability. Liability issues will be fully managed by the PCO in line with local
agreements with practices and via UK national service level agreements with
suppliers removing the responsibility from the GP.</p>
<h2 id="choice-of-nationally-accredited-systems">Choice of nationally accredited systems</h2>
<p>4.34 Systems will be accredited against national standards. Each practice will have guaranteed
choice from a number of accredited systems that deliver the required functionality. Such
choices will be consistent with local development plans (or their equivalents) and in line with
local business cases and service level agreements. From 1 April 2003 every practice in the UK
will have the choice of RFA-accredited systems. Practices will not subsequently be expected
to exercise this right more frequently than every three years.</p>
<p>4.35 As patient care is increasingly delivered across multiple organisations, professions and sectors,
the ability to implement nationally specified systems to support these arrangements is
regarded as essential.</p>
<p>4.36 The GPC, NHS Confederation and Health Departments across the four countries appreciate
and value the information held in current practice systems. Future strategies will ensure this
information is protected.</p>
<h2 id="development-implementation-and-support-for-primary-care-imt-systems">Development, implementation and support for primary care IM&amp;T systems</h2>
<p>4.37 UK standards that accommodate the specific requirements of the four countries will cover
the development, implementation and support of IT systems in primary care. These will
include standards and protocols relating to the access and management of electronic patient
records, including the transition from existing arrangements.</p>
<p>4.38 Taking into account the different models of purchasing systems across the four countries, a
national template SLA will be developed to support the development of future primary care
IT systems providing practices with assurances on training, maintenance and support. The
national template will allow local enhancements and additions in line with national
programmes.</p>
<p>4.39 Practices will receive hardware and software upgrades from their supplier in a rolling
programme as specified in their SLA. Mechanisms will be put in place to manage supplier
failure to deliver systems in line with the SLA, which may also be subject to periodic reviews
of implemented systems against the approved practice business case.</p>
<p>4.40 Professional bodies, including the GPC, will be fully involved in the definition of national
agreements, standards and systems requirements and service level agreements that underpin
them.</p>
<h2 id="minimum-functionality-specification">Minimum functionality specification</h2>
<p>4.41 Work is continuing to develop a minimum functionality specification for practice systems that
defines the information requirements to deliver integrated care and meets the requirements
of the new GMS contract.</p>
<h2 id="education-and-training-in-use-of-imt">Education and training in use of IM&amp;T</h2>
<p>4.42 The initial and continuing education, training and support in the use of IM&amp;T will be
managed and properly funded by the PCO as part of a continuing practice development
programme. Further information will be provided as part of the overall guidance on implementation of the contract.</p>
<p>4.43 In order to fulfil their new contractual obligations, practices will have to enter and retrieve
high quality information from their practice clinical systems. Mechanisms will be put in place
to ensure practice staff are fully supported with continuing training and education to ensure
they are able to:
(i) use and manage their particular clinical and administrative information systems
including data entry and retrieval
(ii) understand clinical nomenclatures and classifications
(iii) ensure data quality
(iv) implement change management and strategies to enable the move from paper to
electronic records
(v) manage the risks associated with an IT-dependent working environment including
disaster recovery and ensuring operational continuity
(vi) develop and implement workforce strategies to cope with the summarisation tasks
associated with all clinical data flows into the practice.</p>
<p>4.44 Practices will ensure that practice IT systems which have been funded in whole or in part
under previous NHS funding arrangements will continue to be available to support the new
GMS contract on the basis of the new funding arrangements outlined in this chapter.</p>
<h2 id="innovation-in-imt">Innovation in IM&amp;T</h2>
<p>4.45 Funding for innovation in the use of IM&amp;T to support and enhance the delivery of patient
care in general practice will come from a variety of funding streams including national
sources.</p>
<p>4.46 It will be important for PCOs to ensure that any funding used to develop IM&amp;T over and
above the minimum requirements is in line with each country’s IM&amp;T strategy and an
evaluation programme is developed.</p>
<h2 id="gp-to-gp-patient-record-transfer">GP-to-GP patient record transfer</h2>
<p>4.47 The new GMS contract requires greater use of the clinical system to record patient
information. Key to the successful delivery of efficient and accurate data recording will be
ease of transfer of data between practices. The ‘GP-to-GP record transfer’ project will enable
clinical information to be transferred from one clinical system to another without the need
for re-keying and therefore will save time and resources.
Implementation</p>
